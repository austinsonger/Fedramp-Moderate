<li>Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:</li>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;</li>
<li>Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and</li>
<li>Measuring vulnerability impact;</li>
</ol>
<li>Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments</li>
<li>Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities; [FedRAMP Assignment: high-risk vulnerabilities mitigated within thirty (30) days from date of discovery; moderate risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety (90) days from date of discovery; low risk vulnerabilities mitigated within one hundred and eighty (180) days from date of discovery], in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and</li>
<li>Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).</li>
