### SC-20 Secure Name / Address Resolution Service (Authoritative Source) (L) (M) (H)
The information system:
<ol type="a">
<li>Provides additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries; and</li>
<li>Provides the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.</li>
