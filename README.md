## 1.   Information System Name/Title <a href="#_heading-h.2et92p0" id="_heading-h.2et92p0"></a>

This System Security Plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the Information System Name (Enter Information System Abbreviation) and describes the controls in place or planned for implementation to provide a level of security appropriate for the information to be transmitted, processed or stored by the system.  Information security is vital to our critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is a key component of our national security program.  Proper management of information technology systems is essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data transmitted, processed or stored by the Enter Information System Abbreviation information system.&#x20;

The security safeguards implemented for the Enter Information System Abbreviation system meet the policy and control requirements set forth in this System Security Plan.  All systems are subject to monitoring consistent with applicable laws, regulations, agency policies, procedures and practices.&#x20;

_Table 1-1. Information System Name and Title_

| Unique Identifier                   | Information System Name | Information System Abbreviation       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| \<Enter FedRAMP Application Number> | Information System Name | Enter Information System Abbreviation |

&#x20;

## 2.   Information System Categorization <a href="#_heading-h.3dy6vkm" id="_heading-h.3dy6vkm"></a>

The overall information system sensitivity categorization is recorded in Table 2-1 Security Categorization that follows.  Directions for attaching the FIPS 199 document may be found in the following section: ATTACHMENT 10 - FIPS 199_._

_Table 2-1. Security Categorization_

| System Sensitivity Level: | Choose level. |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |

&#x20;

### 2.1. Information Types <a href="#_heading-h.4d34og8" id="_heading-h.4d34og8"></a>

This section describes how the information types used by the information system are categorized for confidentiality, integrity and availability sensitivity levels.&#x20;

The following tables identify the information types that are input, stored, processed and/or output from Enter Information System Abbreviation.  The selection of the information types is based on guidance provided by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office Business Reference Model 2.0 and FIPS Pub 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems which is based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories.&#x20;

The tables also identify the security impact levels for confidentiality, integrity and availability for each of the information types expressed as low, moderate, or high.  The security impact levels are based on the potential impact definitions for each of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability) discussed in NIST SP 800-60 and FIPS Pub 199.&#x20;

The potential impact is low if—

●      The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;

●      A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.

●      The potential impact is moderate if—

●      The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;

●      A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

●      The potential impact is high if—

●      The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;

●      A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.&#x20;

Example:

| <p>Information Type</p><p>(Use only information types from NIST SP 800-60, Volumes I and II as amended)</p> | NIST 800-60 identifier for Associated Information Type | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| System Development                                                                                          | C.3.5.1                                                | Low             | Moderate  | Low          |

### 8.3. Leveraged Authorizations <a href="#_heading-h.3o7alnk" id="_heading-h.3o7alnk"></a>

_Instruction: The FedRAMP program qualifies different service layers for Authorizations.  One or multiple service layers can be qualified in one System Security Plan. If a lower-level layer has been granted an Authorization and another higher-level layer represented by this SSP plans to leverage a lower layer’s Authorization, this System Security Plan must clearly state that intention.  If an information system does not leverage any pre-existing Authorizations, write “None” in the first column of the table that follows.  Add as many rows as necessary in the table that follows._

_Delete this and all other instructions from your final version of this document._

## 13.     Minimum Security Controls <a href="#_heading-h.2zbgiuw" id="_heading-h.2zbgiuw"></a>

Security controls must meet minimum security control baseline requirements.  Upon categorizing a system as Low, Moderate, or High sensitivity in accordance with FIPS 199, the corresponding security control baseline standards apply.  Some of the control baselines have enhanced controls which are indicated in parentheses.&#x20;

Security controls that are representative of the sensitivity of Enter Information System Abbreviation are described in the sections that follow.  Security controls that are designated as “Not Selected” or “Withdrawn by NIST” are not described unless they have additional FedRAMP controls.  Guidance on how to describe the implemented standard can be found in NIST 800-53, Rev 4.  Control enhancements are marked in parentheses in the sensitivity columns.&#x20;

Systems that are categorized as FIPS 199 Low use the controls designated as Low, systems categorized as FIPS 199 Moderate use the controls designated as Moderate and systems categorized as FIPS 199 High use the controls designated as High.  A summary of which security standards pertain to which sensitivity level is found in Table 13-1 Summary of Required Security Controls that follows.

## 1.   Information System Name/Title <a href="#_heading-h.2et92p0" id="_heading-h.2et92p0"></a>

This System Security Plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the Information System Name (Enter Information System Abbreviation) and describes the controls in place or planned for implementation to provide a level of security appropriate for the information to be transmitted, processed or stored by the system.  Information security is vital to our critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is a key component of our national security program.  Proper management of information technology systems is essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data transmitted, processed or stored by the Enter Information System Abbreviation information system.&#x20;

The security safeguards implemented for the Enter Information System Abbreviation system meet the policy and control requirements set forth in this System Security Plan.  All systems are subject to monitoring consistent with applicable laws, regulations, agency policies, procedures and practices.&#x20;

_Table 1-1. Information System Name and Title_

| Unique Identifier                   | Information System Name | Information System Abbreviation       |

&#x20;

## 2.   Information System Categorization <a href="#_heading-h.3dy6vkm" id="_heading-h.3dy6vkm"></a>

The overall information system sensitivity categorization is recorded in Table 2-1 Security Categorization that follows.  Directions for attaching the FIPS 199 document may be found in the following section: ATTACHMENT 10 - FIPS 199_._

_Table 2-1. Security Categorization_

| System Sensitivity Level: | Choose level. |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |

&#x20;

### 2.1. Information Types <a href="#_heading-h.4d34og8" id="_heading-h.4d34og8"></a>

This section describes how the information types used by the information system are categorized for confidentiality, integrity and availability sensitivity levels.&#x20;

The following tables identify the information types that are input, stored, processed and/or output from Enter Information System Abbreviation.  The selection of the information types is based on guidance provided by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office Business Reference Model 2.0 and FIPS Pub 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems which is based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories.&#x20;

The tables also identify the security impact levels for confidentiality, integrity and availability for each of the information types expressed as low, moderate, or high.  The security impact levels are based on the potential impact definitions for each of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability) discussed in NIST SP 800-60 and FIPS Pub 199.&#x20;

The potential impact is low if—

●      The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;

●      A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.

●      The potential impact is moderate if—

●      The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;

●      A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

●      The potential impact is high if—

●      The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;

●      A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.&#x20;

### 8.3. Leveraged Authorizations <a href="#_heading-h.3o7alnk" id="_heading-h.3o7alnk"></a>

_Instruction: The FedRAMP program qualifies different service layers for Authorizations.  One or multiple service layers can be qualified in one System Security Plan. If a lower-level layer has been granted an Authorization and another higher-level layer represented by this SSP plans to leverage a lower layer’s Authorization, this System Security Plan must clearly state that intention.  If an information system does not leverage any pre-existing Authorizations, write “None” in the first column of the table that follows.  Add as many rows as necessary in the table that follows._

_Delete this and all other instructions from your final version of this document._

The Enter Information System Abbreviation Choose an item leverages a pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization.  FedRAMP Authorizations leveraged by this Enter Information System Abbreviation are listed in Table 8-3 Leveraged Authorizations that follows.

_Instruction: In the space that follows, provide an explicit definition of the system’s Authorization Boundary.  Provide a diagram that portrays this Authorization Boundary and all its connections and components, including the means for monitoring and controlling communications at the external boundary and at key internal boundaries within the system. Address all components and managed interfaces of the information system authorized for operation (e.g., routers, firewalls)._

_The diagram must include a predominant border drawn around all system components and services included in the authorization boundary. The diagram must be easy to read and understand._

_Formal names of components as they are known at the service provider organization in functional specifications, configuration guides, other documents and live configurations shall be named on the diagram and described. Components identified in the Boundary diagram should be consistent with the Network diagram and the inventory(ies). Provide a key to symbols used.  Ensure consistency between the boundary and network diagrams and respective descriptions (Section 9.4) and the appropriate Security Controls \[AC-20, CA-3(1)]._&#x20;

## 13.     Minimum Security Controls <a href="#_heading-h.2zbgiuw" id="_heading-h.2zbgiuw"></a>

Security controls must meet minimum security control baseline requirements.  Upon categorizing a system as Low, Moderate, or High sensitivity in accordance with FIPS 199, the corresponding security control baseline standards apply.  Some of the control baselines have enhanced controls which are indicated in parentheses.&#x20;

Security controls that are representative of the sensitivity of Enter Information System Abbreviation are described in the sections that follow.  Security controls that are designated as “Not Selected” or “Withdrawn by NIST” are not described unless they have additional FedRAMP controls.  Guidance on how to describe the implemented standard can be found in NIST 800-53, Rev 4.  Control enhancements are marked in parentheses in the sensitivity columns.&#x20;

Systems that are categorized as FIPS 199 Low use the controls designated as Low, systems categorized as FIPS 199 Moderate use the controls designated as Moderate and systems categorized as FIPS 199 High use the controls designated as High.  A summary of which security standards pertain to which sensitivity level is found in Table 13-1 Summary of Required Security Controls that follows.

### AC-11 Session Lock (M) (H)

The information system:

1. Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after \[FedRAMP Assignment: fifteen (15) minutes] of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and
2. Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

#### AU-2 Audit Events (L) (M) (H)

The organization:

1. Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: \[FedRAMP Assignment: \[Successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events. For Web applications: all administrator activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes];
2. Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events
3. Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and
4. Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: \[FedRAMP Assignment: organization-defined subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. to be audited continually for each identified event].
5. AU-2 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
   Requirement: Coordination between service provider and consumer shall be documented and accepted by the JAB/AO.

#### AU-3 (1) Control Enhancement (M)

The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information: \[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information].\
AU-3 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
Requirement: The service provider defines audit record types \[FedRAMP Assignment: session, connection, transaction, or activity duration; for client-server transactions, the number of bytes received and bytes sent; additional informational messages to diagnose or identify the event; characteristics that describe or identify the object or resource being acted upon]. The audit record types are approved and accepted by the JAB.\
Guidance: For client-server transactions, the number of bytes sent and received gives bidirectional transfer information that can be helpful during an investigation or inquiry.

#### AU-8 (1) Control Enhancement (M) (H)

The information system:

1. Compares the internal information system clocks with \[FedRAMP Assignment: authoritative time source: \[http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi] \[at least hourly]]; and
2. Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than \[Assignment: organization-defined time period].
3. AU-8 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
   Requirement: The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers used by the NIST Internet time service. The secondary server is selected from a different geographic region than the primary server.\
   Requirement:< The service provider synchronizes the system clocks of network computers that run operating systems other than Windows to the Windows Server Domain Controller emulator or to the same time source for that server.\
   Guidance: The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers used by the NIST Internet time service, or by a Stratum-1 time server. The secondary server is selected from a different geographic region than the primary server.\
   If using Windows Active Directory, all servers should synchronize time with the time source for the Windows Domain Controller. If using some other directory services (e.g., LDAP), all servers should synchronize time with the time source for the directory server. Synchronization of system clocks improves the accuracy of log analysis.

#### CM-6 Configuration Settings (L) (M) (H)

The organization:

1. Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products employed within the information system using \[FedRAMP Assignment: see CM-6(a) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements;
2. CM-6(a) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
   Requirement 1: The service provider shall use the Center for Internet Security guidelines (Level 1) to establish configuration settings or establishes its own configuration settings if USGCB is not available. If no recognized USGCB is available for the technology in use, the CSP should create their own baseline and include a justification statement as to how they came up with the baseline configuration settings.\
   Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) (http://scap.nist.gov/) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).\
   Guidance: Information on the USGCB checklists can be found at: https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/United-States-Government-Configuration-Baseline.
3. Implements the configuration settings;
4. Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for \[Assignment: organization-defined information system components] based on \[Assignment: organization-defined operational requirements]; and
5. Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.

#### CP-7 (1) Control Enhancement (M) (H)

The organization identifies an alternate processing site that is separated from the primary processing site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.\
CP-7 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance\
Guidance: The service provider may determine what is considered a sufficient degree of separation between the primary and alternate processing sites, based on the types of threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e., hostile cyber-attack), the degree of separation between sites will be less relevant.

#### IA-4 Identifier Management (L) (M)

The organization manages information system identifiers for users and devices by:

1. Receiving authorization from \[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign an individual, group, role, or device identifier;
2. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;
3. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;
4. Preventing reuse of identifiers for \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least two (2) years]; and
5. Disabling the identifier after \[FedRAMP Assignment: ninety days for user identifiers (see additional requirements and guidance)]
6. IA-4e Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
   Requirement: The service provider defines the time period of inactivity for device identifiers. Guidance: For DoD clouds, see DoD cloud website for specific DoD requirements that go above and beyond FedRAMP http://iase.disa.mil/cloud\_security/Pages/index.aspx.

#### IA-5 Authenticator Management (L) (M)

The organization manages information system authenticators by:

1. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;
2. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;
3. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
4. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
5. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;
6. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;
7. Changing/refreshing authenticators \[Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator type].
8. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
9. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and
10. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

#### IA-5 (1) Control Enhancement (L) (M)

The information system, for password-based authentication:

1. Enforces minimum password complexity of \[Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];
2. Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least one (1)];
3. Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;
4. Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of \[Assignment: organization- defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
5. Prohibits password reuse for \[FedRAMP Assignment: twenty-four (24)] generations; and
6. Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.

#### IA-5 (2) Control Enhancement (M) (H)

The information system, for PKI-based authentication:

1. Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information;
2. Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
3. Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
4. Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the network.

#### RA-5 Vulnerability Scanning (L) (M) (H)

The organization:

1. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications \[FedRAMP Assignment: monthly operating system/infrastructure; monthly web applications and databases] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;
2. RA-5 (a) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
   Requirement: An accredited independent assessor scans operating systems/infrastructure, web applications, and databases once annually.
3. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
4.
   1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
   2. Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and
   3. Measuring vulnerability impact;
5. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments
6. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities; \[FedRAMP Assignment: high-risk vulnerabilities mitigated within thirty (30) days from date of discovery; moderate risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety (90) days from date of discovery; low risk vulnerabilities mitigated within one hundred and eighty (180) days from date of discovery], in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
7. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with \[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
8. RA-5 (e) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:\
   Requirement: To include all Authorizing Officials; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP.\

#### SC-7 (4) Control Enhancement (M)

The organization:

1. Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;
2. Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;
3. Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;
4. Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need and duration of that need; and
5. Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least at least annually] and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.

#### SC-20 Secure Name / Address Resolution Service (Authoritative Source) (L) (M) (H)

The information system:

1. Provides additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries; and
2. Provides the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.

#### SI-6 Security Functionality Verification (M) (H)

The information system:

1. Verifies the correct operation of \[Assignment: organization-defined security functions];
2. Performs this verification \[FedRAMP Assignment: to include upon system startup and/or restart at least monthly];
3. Notifies \[FedRAMP Assignment: to include system administrators and security personnel] of failed security verification tests; and
4. \[Selection (one or more): shuts the information system down; restarts the information system; \[FedRAMP Assignment: to include notification of system administrators and security personnel] when anomalies are discovered.
