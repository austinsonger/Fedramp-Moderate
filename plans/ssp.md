## 1.   Information System Name/Title <a href="#_heading-h.2et92p0" id="_heading-h.2et92p0"></a>

This System Security Plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the Information System Name (Enter Information System Abbreviation) and describes the controls in place or planned for implementation to provide a level of security appropriate for the information to be transmitted, processed or stored by the system.  Information security is vital to our critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is a key component of our national security program.  Proper management of information technology systems is essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data transmitted, processed or stored by the Enter Information System Abbreviation information system.&#x20;

The security safeguards implemented for the Enter Information System Abbreviation system meet the policy and control requirements set forth in this System Security Plan.  All systems are subject to monitoring consistent with applicable laws, regulations, agency policies, procedures and practices.&#x20;

_Table 1-1. Information System Name and Title_

| Unique Identifier                   | Information System Name | Information System Abbreviation       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| \<Enter FedRAMP Application Number> | Information System Name | Enter Information System Abbreviation |

&#x20;

## 2.   Information System Categorization <a href="#_heading-h.3dy6vkm" id="_heading-h.3dy6vkm"></a>

The overall information system sensitivity categorization is recorded in Table 2-1 Security Categorization that follows.  Directions for attaching the FIPS 199 document may be found in the following section: ATTACHMENT 10 - FIPS 199_._

_Table 2-1. Security Categorization_

| System Sensitivity Level: | Choose level. |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |

&#x20;

### 2.1. Information Types <a href="#_heading-h.4d34og8" id="_heading-h.4d34og8"></a>

This section describes how the information types used by the information system are categorized for confidentiality, integrity and availability sensitivity levels.&#x20;

The following tables identify the information types that are input, stored, processed and/or output from Enter Information System Abbreviation.  The selection of the information types is based on guidance provided by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office Business Reference Model 2.0 and FIPS Pub 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems which is based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories.&#x20;

The tables also identify the security impact levels for confidentiality, integrity and availability for each of the information types expressed as low, moderate, or high.  The security impact levels are based on the potential impact definitions for each of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability) discussed in NIST SP 800-60 and FIPS Pub 199.&#x20;

The potential impact is low if—

- The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;
- A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.

The potential impact is moderate if—

- The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;
- A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

The potential impact is high if—

- The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.&#x20;
- A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.&#x20;

Example:

| <p>Information Type</p><p>(Use only information types from NIST SP 800-60, Volumes I and II as amended)</p> | NIST 800-60 identifier for Associated Information Type | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |

### 8.3. Leveraged Authorizations <a href="#_heading-h.3o7alnk" id="_heading-h.3o7alnk"></a>

_Instruction: The FedRAMP program qualifies different service layers for Authorizations.  One or multiple service layers can be qualified in one System Security Plan. If a lower-level layer has been granted an Authorization and another higher-level layer represented by this SSP plans to leverage a lower layer’s Authorization, this System Security Plan must clearly state that intention.  If an information system does not leverage any pre-existing Authorizations, write “None” in the first column of the table that follows.  Add as many rows as necessary in the table that follows._

_Delete this and all other instructions from your final version of this document._

## 13.     Minimum Security Controls <a href="#_heading-h.2zbgiuw" id="_heading-h.2zbgiuw"></a>

Security controls must meet minimum security control baseline requirements.  Upon categorizing a system as Low, Moderate, or High sensitivity in accordance with FIPS 199, the corresponding security control baseline standards apply.  Some of the control baselines have enhanced controls which are indicated in parentheses.&#x20;

Security controls that are representative of the sensitivity of Enter Information System Abbreviation are described in the sections that follow.  Security controls that are designated as “Not Selected” or “Withdrawn by NIST” are not described unless they have additional FedRAMP controls.  Guidance on how to describe the implemented standard can be found in NIST 800-53, Rev 4.  Control enhancements are marked in parentheses in the sensitivity columns.&#x20;

Systems that are categorized as FIPS 199 Low use the controls designated as Low, systems categorized as FIPS 199 Moderate use the controls designated as Moderate and systems categorized as FIPS 199 High use the controls designated as High.  A summary of which security standards pertain to which sensitivity level is found in Table 13-1 Summary of Required Security Controls that follows.

| Service Provider Corporate                        | A control that originates from the CSP Name corporate network.                                                               | DNS from the corporate network provides address resolution services for the information system and the service offering.                                                                                         |
| Service Provider System Specific                  | A control specific to a particular system at the CSP Name and the control is not part of the standard corporate controls.    | A unique host-based intrusion detection system (HIDs) is available on the service offering platform but is not available on the corporate network.                                                               |
| Service Provider Hybrid                           | A control that makes use of both corporate controls and additional controls specific to a particular system at the CSP Name. | There are scans of the corporate network infrastructure; scans of databases and web-based application are system specific.                                                                                       |
| Configured by Customer                            | A control where the customer needs to apply a configuration in order to meet the control requirement.                        | User profiles, policy/audit configurations, enabling/disabling key switches (e.g., enable/disable http\* or https, etc.), entering an IP range specific to their organization are configurable by the customer.  |
| Provided by Customer                              | A control where the customer needs to provide additional hardware or software in order to meet the control requirement.      | The customer provides a SAML SSO solution to implement two-factor authentication.                                                                                                                                |
| Shared                                            | A control that is managed and implemented partially by the CSP Name and partially by the customer.                           | Security awareness training must be conducted by both the CSPN and the customer.                                                                                                                                 |
| Inherited from pre-existing FedRAMP Authorization | A control that is inherited from another CSP Name system that has already received a FedRAMP Authorization.                  | A PaaS or SaaS provider inherits PE controls from an IaaS provider.                                                                                                                                              |
